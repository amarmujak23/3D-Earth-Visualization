# 3D-Earth-Visualization
A 3D Earth made with HTML, JavaScript, Three.js and WebGL

Key Features:

3D Rendering: Utilizes Three.js to create a detailed 3D model of Earth, complete with textures and atmospheric effects.
Interactivity: Incorporates interactive controls for users to manipulate and navigate the 3D globe.
Dynamic Elements: Includes animated stars in the background to enhance the visual experience.
Welcome Animation: Provides a welcome overlay with a fading-in effect for an engaging start.
Challenges:

CORS Restrictions: Overcame CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) limitations to properly load external textures for the Earth model.
Optimization: Focused on optimizing rendering and animation performance for smoother interactions across various devices.
Responsive Design: Ensured responsiveness to cater to different screen sizes for a consistent user experience.
Technologies Used:

Three.js: Employed for creating and rendering the 3D Earth model and implementing interactive controls.
JavaScript/HTML/CSS: Utilized for the web-based interface and interactivity.
Node.js (Optional): Deployed a local server to handle CORS issues during development.
Future Enhancements:

Advanced Atmospheric Effects: Explore shader-based effects for more realistic atmospheric visuals.
Performance Optimization: Continue optimizing rendering for enhanced performance.
Responsive Design Refinement: Further refine responsiveness across various devices.
